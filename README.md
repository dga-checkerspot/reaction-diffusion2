# Reaction-Diffusion

## General structure

This will require a little command line knowledge for Mac or Linux but if you can do that and install docker it should be robust to issues of custom software installation and what what operating system/version you are using

### Docker

My first attempt to locally execute [this](https://github.com/aschinchon/reaction-diffusion) failed on my mac because of gcc related issues so I've set it up to run on a virtual machine with docker

### Step 1 Get Docker

Download and install docker (for example from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Step 2 Get This Repo

Download the files from this github repo (either with git clone) or by clicking the green code download button

### Step 3 Navigate to the directory containing this code

Open a terminal window and use cd to navigate to the directory containing the files from this repository.
If you used the green button to download it's likely a zip file in your downloads.
After you have unzipped the folder it would likely be a command like `cd Downloads/reaction-diffusion2`

### Step 4 run the docker code from the command line

```{bash}
docker run -v $PWD:/opt/ -d -it --name tidy rocker/tidyverse
```

Then

```{bash}
docker exec -it tidy bash -c "cd /opt/ ; Rscript reaction_diffusion.R"
```


### Completion!

You should have a file called GreyScott.png with your image



## From the original github source

Check it out [here](https://github.com/aschinchon/reaction-diffusion)

An R experiment to create images generated by the [Gray-Scott algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system). Examples:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following packages (if you don't have them already):

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("colourlovers")
```
